//! Single source of truth for "is this path a git repository?" detection.
//!
//! The check is deliberately strict: the exact path must contain a `.git`
//! entry (directory for regular repos, file for linked worktrees and
//! submodules). We do **not** walk up to ancestors.
//!
//! Rationale: codeg scopes every workspace-facing feature (file tree
//! watcher, git changes panel, log panel) to the directory the user opens.
//! If one code path walks up and another doesn't, the UI falls into a
//! "schizophrenic" state where some panels see a repo and others don't.
//! Keeping the primitive strict forces every consumer onto the same
//! interpretation.
//!
//! Bare repositories are intentionally not supported — they have no working
//! tree, which makes them an unusual target for a workspace-oriented editor.
